# Tic-Tac-Toe

A small app intended to explore classes properties and access modifers.

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. 
You will also need xunit testing. 
You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.

## Features

This program uses two classes in addition to the program class to create a simple implementation of tic-tac-toe. You can create two new players, selsecting a name and symbol for both. Then play a game of tic-tac-toe. Once a winner is determined the game will off to start again with the same players.
